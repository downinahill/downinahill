### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fast learner, eager to learn anything about technology and I've grown a lot in this field over the past year. I'm an artist who's passionate about a number of things. I want to leave a lasting positive impact on the world. I'm curious, tenacious, and willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. I've been more focused on front end, but I want to know everything there is to know about software engineering.
